# element.scrollIntoViewIfNeeded Polyfill for everyone

This gist provides a simple JavaScript implementation of the non-standard WebKit method ```scrollIntoViewIfNeeded``` that can be called on DOM elements.

Install
-------

```npm install element.scrollintoviewifneeded-polyfill```

Usage
-----

Just use the code in ```index.js``` in your app or website. You can see usage in the test page ```test.html```.

The parent element will only scroll if the element being called is out of the view. The boolean can force the element to be centered in the scrolling area.

Improvements
------------

* This code doesn't handle well cases where the element has ```position:absolute``` (and maybe other CSS modifications).
* This code doesn't handle cases where the scroll area isn't the direct parent of the target element.
