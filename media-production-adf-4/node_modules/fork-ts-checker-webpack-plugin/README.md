[![Npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/realytics/fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin)

Webpack plugin that runs typescript type checker on a separate process.
 
## Installation
This plugin requires minimum **webpack 2**, **typescript 2.1** and optionally **tslint 5.0**
```sh
npm install --save-dev fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin
```
Basic webpack config (with [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader))
```js
var ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin = require('fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin');

var webpackConfig = {
  context: __dirname, // to automatically find tsconfig.json
  entry: './src/index.ts',
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.tsx?$/,
        loader: 'ts-loader',
        options: {
          // disable type checker - we will use it in fork plugin
          transpileOnly: true 
        }
      }
    ]
  },
  plugins: [
    new ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin()
  ]
};
```

## Motivation
There is already similar solution - [awesome-typescript-loader](https://github.com/s-panferov/awesome-typescript-loader). You can
add `CheckerPlugin` and delegate checker to the separate process. The problem with `awesome-typescript-loader` was that, in our case,
it was a lot slower than [ts-loader](https://github.com/TypeStrong/ts-loader) on an incremental build (~20s vs ~3s).
Secondly, we use [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint) and we wanted to run this, along with type checker, in a separate process.
This is why we've created this plugin. To provide better performance, plugin reuses Abstract Syntax Trees between compilations and shares 
these trees with tslint. It can be scaled with a multi-process mode to utilize maximum CPU power.

## Modules resolution
It's very important to be aware that **this plugin uses [typescript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)'s, not 
[webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack)'s modules resolution**. It means that you have to setup `tsconfig.json` correctly. For example 
if you set `files: ['./src/someFile.ts']` in `tsconfig.json`, this plugin will check only `someFile.ts` for semantic errors. It's because 
of performance. The goal of this plugin is to be *as fast as possible*. With typescript's module resolution we don't have to wait for webpack 
to compile files (which traverses dependency graph during compilation) - we have a full list of files from the begin.

To debug typescript's modules resolution, you can use `tsc --traceResolution` command.

## TSLint
If you have installed [tslint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint), you can enable it by setting `tslint: true` or 
`tslint: './path/to/tslint.json'`. We recommend changing `defaultSeverity` to a `"warning"` in `tslint.json` file. 
It helps to distinguish lints from typescript's diagnostics.

## Options
* **tsconfig** `string`:
Path to *tsconfig.json* file. Default: `path.resolve(compiler.options.context, './tsconfig.json')`.

* **tslint** `string | true`: 
Path to *tslint.json* file or `true`. If `true`, uses `path.resolve(compiler.options.context, './tslint.json')`. Default: `undefined`.

* **watch** `string | string[]`: 
Directories or files to watch by service. Not necessary but improves performance (reduces number of `fs.stat` calls).
                                  
* **ignoreDiagnostics** `number[]`:
List of typescript diagnostic codes to ignore.

* **ignoreLints** `string[]`: 
List of tslint rule names to ignore.

* **colors** `boolean`:
If `false`, disables built-in colors in logger messages. Default: `true`.

* **logger** `object`:
Logger instance. It should be object that implements method: `error`, `warn`, `info`. Default: `console`.

* **silent** `boolean`:
If `true`, logger will not be used. Default: `false`.

* **memoryLimit** `number`: 
Memory limit for service process in MB. If service exits with allocation failed error, increase this number. Default: `2048`.

* **workers** `number`:
You can split type checking to a few workers to speed-up increment build. **Be careful** - if you don't want to increase build time, you 
should keep free 1 core for *build* and 1 core for a *system* *(for example system with 4 CPUs should use max 2 workers)*. Second thing -
node doesn't share memory between workers - keep in mind that memory usage will increase. Be aware that in some scenarios increasing workers
number **can increase checking time**. Default: `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin.ONE_CPU`.

### Pre-computed consts:      
  * `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin.ONE_CPU` - always use one CPU
  * `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin.ALL_CPUS` - always use all CPUs (will increase build time)
  * `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin.ONE_CPU_FREE` - leave only one CPU for build (probably will increase build time)
  * `ForkTsCheckerWebpackPlugin.TWO_CPUS_FREE` - **recommended** - leave two CPUs free (one for build, one for system)

## Plugin Hooks
This plugin provides some custom webpack hooks (all are sync):

| Event name | Description | Params |
|------------|-------------|--------|
|`fork-ts-checker-cancel`| Cancellation has been requested | `cancellationToken` |
|`fork-ts-checker-waiting`| Waiting for results | `hasTsLint` |
|`fork-ts-checker-service-start`| Service will be started | `tsconfigPath`, `tslintPath`, `watchPaths`, `workersNumber`, `memoryLimit` |
|`fork-ts-checker-service-start-error` | Cannot start service | `error` |
|`fork-ts-checker-service-out-of-memory`| Service is out of memory | - |
|`fork-ts-checker-receive`| Plugin receives diagnostics and lints from service | `diagnostics`, `lints` | 
|`fork-ts-checker-emit`| Service will add errors and warnings to webpack compilation ('build' mode) | `diagnostics`, `lints`, `elapsed` |
|`fork-ts-checker-done`| Service finished type checking and webpack finished compilation ('watch' mode) | `diagnostics`, `lints`, `elapsed` |
